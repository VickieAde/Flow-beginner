# NFT-Project

In this NFT-Project, I've enhanced the existing NFT contract by introducing a new function called `borrowAuthNFT`. This function enables others to retrieve our NFT's metadata.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- [Flow Playground](https://play.flow.com/)
- Cadence Language

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to utilize this project:

1. Visit the [Flow Playground](https://play.flow.com/) and create your Contracts, Transactions, and Scripts files.

2. Execute the `CreateCollection` transaction to establish your NFT collection.

3. Run the `MintNFT` transaction to create a new NFT.

4. Execute the `GetID` script to obtain the NFT ID needed for the main script.

5. Utilize the `MetaData` script to access and retrieve data from the NFT you've generated.
